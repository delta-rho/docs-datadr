# Store/Compute Backends

## Backend Choices

The examples we have seen so far have used very small datasets.  What if we have more data than fits in memory?  In this section we cover additional backends to datadr that allow us to scale the D&R approach to very large datasets.

datadr has been designed to be extensible, providing the same interface to multiple backends.  Thus all of the examples we have illustrated so far can be run with the code unchanged on data registered to a different backend.

The general requirements for a backend to the datadr interface are key-value storage and MapReduce computation.

<!-- ![scalableenv](image/scalableenv.png) -->

Additionally, a backend must have bindings allow us to access data and interface with MapReduce from inside of R.

All of the examples we have seen so far have been for "small" data, using in-memory R lists as the key-value store and a simple R implementation of MapReduce to provide computation.  Two other options have been implemented for "medium" and "large" data.

<img src="image/backends4.svg" width="650px" alt="backends" style="display:block; margin:auto"/>

We spend much of our time in RHIPE with very large datasets.  This is the only implemented backend that requires substantial effort to get up and running, which entails installing and configuring Hadoop and RHIPE on a cluster.  The other two options can be used on a single workstation.  The "medium" option stores data on local disk and processes it using multicore R.  This is a great intermediate backend and is particularly useful for processing results of Hadoop data that are still too large to fit into memory.  In addition to operating on small data, the "small" option of in-memory data works well as a backend for reading in a small subset of a larger data set and testing methods before applying across the entire data set.

The "medium" and "large" out-of-memory key-value storage options require a connection to be established with the backend.  Other than that, the only aspect of the interface that changes from one backend to another is a `control` method, from which the user can specify backend-specific settings and parameters.  We will provide examples of how to use these different backends in this section.

For each backend, we will in general follow the process of the following:

- Initiating a connection to the backend
- Adding data to the connection
- Initiating a ddo/ddf on the connection
- A D&R example
- A MapReduce example

## Small: Memory / CPU

The examples we have seen so far have all been based on in-memory key-value pairs.  Thus there will be nothing new in this section.  However, we will go through the process anyway to draw comparisons to the other backends and show how the interface stays the same.

We will stick with a very simple example using the iris data.

### Initiating an in-memory ddf

With the in-memory backend, there is not a storage backend to "connect" to and add data to.  We can jump straight to initializing a ddo/ddf from data we already have in our environment.

For example, suppose we have the following collection of key-value pairs:

```{r memory_add_data}
irisKV <- list(
  list("key1", iris[1:40,]),
  list("key2", iris[41:110,]),
  list("key3", iris[111:150,]))
```

As we have seen before, we can initialize this as a ddf with the following:

```{r memory_ddf, message=FALSE}
# initialize a ddf from irisKV
irisDdf <- ddf(irisKV)
```

### D&R example

For a quick example, let's create a "by species" division of the data, and then do a recombination to compute the coefficients of a linear model of sepal length vs. sepal width:

```{r memory_byspecies, message=FALSE}
# divide in-memory data by species
bySpecies <- divide(irisDdf,
  by = "Species")
```

```{r memory_recombine, message=FALSE}
# transform bySpecies to a data frame of lm coefficients
bySpeciesLm <- addTransform(bySpecies, function(x) {
  coefs <- coef(lm(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length, data = x))
  data.frame(slope = coefs[2], intercept = coefs[1])
})
# compute lm coefficients for each division and rbind them
recombine(bySpeciesLm, combRbind)
```

### MapReduce example

For a MapReduce example, let's take the `bySpecies` data and find the 5 records with the highest sepal width:

```{r memory_top5, message=FALSE}
# map returns top 5 rows according to sepal width
top5map <- expression({
  v <- do.call(rbind, map.values)
  collect("top5", v[order(v$Sepal.Width, decreasing = TRUE)[1:5],])
})

# reduce collects map results and then iteratively rbinds them and returns top 5
top5reduce <- expression(
  pre = {
    top5 <- NULL
  }, reduce = {
    top5 <- rbind(top5, do.call(rbind, reduce.values))
    top5 <- top5[order(top5$Sepal.Width, decreasing = TRUE)[1:5],]
  }, post = {
    collect(reduce.key, top5)
  }
)

# execute the job
top5 <- mrExec(bySpecies, map = top5map, reduce = top5reduce)
# get the result
top5[[1]]
```

Now we'll go through these same steps for the other backends.

## Medium: Disk / Multicore

The "medium" key-value backend stores data on your machine's local disk, and is good for datasets that are bigger than will fit in (or are manageable in) your workstation's memory, but not so big that processing them with the available cores on your workstation becomes infeasible.  Typically this is good for data in the hundreds of megabytes.  It can be useful sometimes to store even very small datasets on local disk.

### Initiating a disk connection

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# remove files if necessary
try(unlink(file.path(tempdir(), "irisKV"), recursive = TRUE))
try(unlink(file.path(tempdir(), "irisKV"), recursive = TRUE))
try(unlink(file.path(tempdir(), "bySpecies"), recursive = TRUE))
try(unlink(file.path(tempdir(), "iris"), recursive = TRUE))
```

To initiate a local disk connection, we use the function `r rdl("localDiskConn()")`, and simply point it to a directory on our local file system.

```{r disk_conn, message=FALSE}
# initiate a disk connection to a new directory /__tempdir__/irisKV
irisDiskConn <- localDiskConn(file.path(tempdir(), "irisKV"), autoYes = TRUE)
```

Note that in this tutorial we are using a temporary directory as the root directory of our local disk objects through calling `tempdir()`.  You wouldn't do this in a real analysis but this makes the example run well in a non-intrusive platform-independent way.

By default, if the directory does not exist, `r rdl("localDiskConn()")` will ask you if you would like to create the directory.  Since we specify `autoYes = TRUE`, the directory is automatically created.

```{r print_disk_conn}
# print the connection object
irisDiskConn
```

`irisDiskConn` is simply a "kvConnection" object that points to the directory.  Meta data containing data attributes is also stored in this directory.  If we lose the connection object `irisDiskConn`, the data still stays on the disk, and we can get our connection back by calling

```{r disk_conn2, message=FALSE}
irisDiskConn <- localDiskConn(file.path(tempdir(), "irisKV"))
```

Any meta data that was there is also read in.  If you would like to connect to a directory but reset all meta data, you can call `r rdl("localDiskConn()")` with `reset = TRUE`.

Data is stored in a local disk connection by creating a new `.Rdata` file for each key-value pair.  For data with a very large number of key-value pairs, we can end up with too many files in a directory for the file system to handle efficiently.  It is possible to specify a parameter `nBins` to `r rdl("localDiskConn()")`, which tells the connection that new data should be equally placed into `nbins` subdirectories.  The default is `nBins = 0`.

### Adding data

We have initiated a "localDiskConn" connection, but it is just an empty directory.  We need to add data to it.  With the same key-value pairs as before:

```{r disk_iris}
irisKV <- list(
  list("key1", iris[1:40,]),
  list("key2", iris[41:110,]),
  list("key3", iris[111:150,]))
```

We can add key-value pairs to the connection with `r rdl("addData()")`, which takes the connection object as its first argument and a list of key-value pairs as the second argument.  For example:

```{r disk_add_data}
addData(irisDiskConn, irisKV[1:2])
```

Here we added the first 2 key-value pairs to disk.  We can verify this by looking in the directory:

```{r disk_ls}
list.files(irisDiskConn$loc)
```

`"_meta"` is a directory where the connection metadata is stored.  The two `.Rdata` files are the two key-value pairs we just added.  The file name is determined by the md5 hash of the data in the key (and we don't have to worry about this).

We can call `r rdl("addData()")` as many times as we would like to continue to add data to the directory.  Let's add the final key-value pair:

```{r disk_add_data2}
addData(irisDiskConn, irisKV[3])
```

Now we have a connection with all of the data in it.

### Initializing a ddf

We can initialize a ddo/ddf with our disk connection object:

```{r disk_ddf, message=FALSE}
# initialize a ddf from irisDiskConn
irisDdf <- ddf(irisDiskConn)
```

As noted before, with in-memory data, we initialize ddo/ddf objects with in-memory key-value pairs.  For all other backends, we pass a connection object.  `irisDdf` is now a distributed data frame that behaves in the same way as the one we created for the in-memory case.  The data itself though is located on disk.

The connection object is saved as an attribute of the ddo/ddf.

```{r print_disk_irisDdf}
# print irisDdf
irisDdf
```

We see that the connection info for the object is added to the printout of `irisDdf`.  Also, note that nearly all of the attributes have not been populated, including the keys.  This is because the data is on disk and we need to pass over it to compute most of the attributes:

```{r disk_ddf_update, message=FALSE}
# update irisDdf attributes
irisDdf <- updateAttributes(irisDdf)
```

### D&R Example

Let's see how the code looks for the D&R example on the local disk data:

```{r disk_byspecies, message=FALSE}
# divide local disk data by species
bySpecies <- divide(irisDdf,
  by = "Species",
  output = localDiskConn(file.path(tempdir(), "bySpecies"), autoYes = TRUE),
  update = TRUE)
```

This code is the same as what we used for the in-memory data except that in `r rdl("divide()")`, we also need to specify an output connection.  If `output` is not provided, an attempt is made to read the data in to an in-memory connection.  Here we specify that we would like the output of the division to be stored on local disk in `"bySpecies"` in our R temporary directory.

As stated before, note that local disk objects persists on disk.  I know where the data and metadata for the `bySpecies` object is located.  If I lose my R session or remove my object, I can get it back.  All attributes are stored as meta data at the connection, so that I don't need to worry about recomputing anything:

```{r remove_disk_byspecies, message=FALSE}
# remove the R object "bySpecies"
rm(bySpecies)
# now reinitialize
bySpecies <- ddf(localDiskConn(file.path(tempdir(), "bySpecies")))
```

The code for the recombination remains exactly the same:

```{r disk_recombine, message = FALSE}
# transform bySpecies to a data frame of lm coefficients
bySpeciesLm <- addTransform(bySpecies, function(x) {
  coefs <- coef(lm(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length, data = x))
  data.frame(slope = coefs[2], intercept = coefs[1])
})
# compute lm coefficients for each division and rbind them
recombine(bySpeciesLm, combRbind)
```

### Interacting with local disk ddo/ddf objects

Note that all interactions with local disk ddo/ddf objects are the same as those we have seen so far.

For example, I can access data by index or by key:

```{r disk_access}
bySpecies[[1]]
bySpecies[["Species=setosa"]]
```

These extractors find the appropriate key-value pair files on disk, read them in, and return them.

Also, all the accessors like `getKeys()` work just the same:

```{r disk_getkeys}
getKeys(bySpecies)
```

### MapReduce example

Here we again find the top 5 `iris` records according to sepal width.

```{r disk_top5, message=FALSE}
# map returns top 5 rows according to sepal width
top5map <- expression({
  counter("map", "mapTasks", 1)
  v <- do.call(rbind, map.values)
  collect("top5", v[order(v$Sepal.Width, decreasing = TRUE)[1:5],])
})

# reduce collects map results and then iteratively rbinds them and returns top 5
top5reduce <- expression(
  pre = {
    top5 <- NULL
  }, reduce = {
    top5 <- rbind(top5, do.call(rbind, reduce.values))
    top5 <- top5[order(top5$Sepal.Width, decreasing = TRUE)[1:5],]
  }, post = {
    collect(reduce.key, top5)
  }
)

# execute the job
top5 <- mrExec(bySpecies, map = top5map, reduce = top5reduce)
# get the result
top5[[1]]
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# options(max.print = 10)
```

I added the line with the call to `counter()` to the map expression to illustrate some of the control parameters described at the end of this section.

### `control` options

There are various aspects of backends that we want to be able to have control oer.  The `control` argument of a MapReduce job provides a general interface to do this.  A `control` argument is simply a named list of settings for various control parameters.

All of the [data operations](#) run MapReduce jobs and therefore have a `control` argument.

Currently, the available control parameters for MapReduce on a local disk connection are:

- `cluster`: a cluster object from `makeCluster()` to use to do distributed computation -- default is `NULL` (single core)
- `mapred_temp_dir`: where to put intermediate key-value pairs in between map and reduce -- default is `tempdir()`
- `map_buff_size_bytes`: the size of batches of key-value pairs to be passed to the map -- default is 10485760 (10 Mb).  The cores in the cluster are filled with key-value pairs to process, up to each collection exceeding this size.
- `map_temp_buff_size_bytes`: the size of the batches of key-value pairs to flush to intermediate storage from the map output -- default is 10485760 (10 Mb)
- `reduce_buff_size_bytes`: the size of the batches of key-value pairs to send to the reduce -- default is 10485760 (10 Mb)

The function `r rdl("localDiskControl()")` is used to create the default list.  Any parameter specified will override the default.

<!-- TODO: talk about options(...) -->

To illustrate the use of `control` for local disk connections, let's rerun the "top 5" MapReduce job but this time with a 3-core cluster:

```{r disk_top5_control, message=FALSE}
# create a 3 core cluster
library(parallel)
cl <- makeCluster(3)

# run MapReduce job with custom control
top5a <- mrExec(bySpecies,
  map = top5map, reduce = top5reduce,
  control = localDiskControl(cluster = cl))
```

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, comment=NA, purl=TRUE}
stopCluster(cl)
```

The map and reduce tasks for this job were run on a 3-core cluster.

<!-- We set `map_buff_size_bytes` to 10.  This means that when sending key-value pairs to the map tasks, input key-value pairs will be bundled into batches of key-value pairs (minimum of 1 key-value pair per batch) that don't exceed 10 bytes.  Since our data is very small, this very low limit ensures that there is only one key-value pair per batch, and therefore that the 3 map tasks will all be doing work.  With the default buffer size of 10 Mb, all 3 input key-value pairs are sent to one map task, and in that case, it is pointless to run a multicore job because only one map task will be run. -->

We can verify that our new computation did indeed run 3 separate map tasks (one on each core) by comparing the counters from the first and second jobs:

```{r top5_counter_compare}
# how many map tasks were there before using a 3-core cluster
counters(top5)$map$mapTasks
# how many map tasks were there after using a 3-core cluster
counters(top5a)$map$mapTasks
```

## Large: HDFS / RHIPE

Very large data sets can be stored on the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).  For this to work, your workstation must be connected to a Hadoop cluster with RHIPE installed.  If you want to try these examples but do not have a Hadoop cluster, we are still using the same small data set and you can download our single-node Vagrant virtual machine -- instructions [here](http://tessera.io/#quickstart).

### HDFS operations with RHIPE

Getting ready for dealing with data in Hadoop can require some Hadoop file system operations.  Here is a quick crash course on the available functions for interacting with HDFS from R using RHIPE.

First we need to load and initialize RHIPE:

```{r load_rhipe, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
library(Rhipe)
rhinit()
```

Now for some of the available commands:

```{r hdfs_ops1, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
# list files in the base directory of HDFS
rhls("/")
```

```
  permission   owner      group size          modtime  file

```{r hdfs_ops2, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}

```

```{r hdfs_ops3, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}

rhwrite(list(list(1, 1), list(2, 2)), file = "/tmp/testfile/1")
```

```
Wrote 0.39 KB,2 chunks, and 2 elements (100% complete)
```

```{r hdfs_ops4, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
# read those values back in
a <- rhread("/tmp/testfile/1")
```

```
Read 2 objects(0.08 KB) in 0.03 seconds
```

```{r hdfs_ops5, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}

d <- rnorm(10)
rhsave(d, file = "/tmp/testfile/d.Rdata")
# load that object back into the session
rhload("/tmp/testfile/d.Rdata")
# list the files in /tmp/testfile
rhls("/tmp/testfile")
```

```

2 /tmp/testfile/d.Rdata
```

```{r hdfs_ops8, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
# delete everything we just did
rhdel("/tmp/testfile")
```

Also see `rhcp()` and `rhmv()`.

### Initiating an HDFS connection

To initiate a connection to data on HDFS, we use the function `r rdl("hdfsConn()")`, and simply point it to a directory on HDFS.

```{r hdfs_conn, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
# initiate an HDFS connection to a new HDFS directory /tmp/irisKV
irisHDFSconn <- hdfsConn("/tmp/irisKV", autoYes = TRUE)
```

Similar to local disk connections, by default, if the HDFS directory does not exist, `r rdl("hdfsConn()")` will ask you if you would like to create the directory.  Since we specify `autoYes = TRUE`, the directory is automatically created.  Also, as with local disk connections, `irisHDFSconn` is simply a "kvConnection" object that points to the HDFS directory which contains or will contain data, and where meta data is stored for the connection.

```{r hdfs_conn_print, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
# print the connection object
irisHDFSconn
```

This simply prints the location of the HDFS directory we are connected to and the type of data it will expect.  `"sequence"` is the default, which is a Hadoop sequence file.  Other options are `"map"` and `"text"`.  These can be specified using the `type` argument to `r rdl("hdfsConn()")`.  See `?hdfsConn` for more details.

### Adding data

There is a method `r rdl("addData()")` available for "hdfsConn" connections, but it is not recommended to use this.  The reason is that for each call of `r rdl("addData()")`, a new file is created on HDFS in the subdirectory that your connection points to.  If you have a lot of data, chances are that you will be adding a lot of individual files.  Hadoop does not like to handle large numbers of files.  If the data is very large, it likes a very small number of very large files.  Having a large number of files slows down job initialization and also requires more map tasks to run than would probably be desired.  However, the method is still available if you would like to use it.  Just note that the typical approach is to begin with data that is already on HDFS in some form (we will cover an example of beginning with text files on HDFS later).

To mimic what was done with the "localDiskConn" example:

```{r hdfs_add_data, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
irisKV <- list(
  list("key1", iris[1:40,]),
  list("key2", iris[41:110,]),
  list("key3", iris[111:150,]))

addData(irisHDFSconn, irisKV)
```

### Initializing a ddf

We can initialize a ddo/ddf by passing the HDFS connection object to `r rdl("ddo()")` or `r rdl("ddf()")`.

```{r hdfs_ddf, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
# initialize a ddf from hdfsConn
irisDdf <- ddf(irisHDFSconn)
irisDdf
```

As with the disk connection `irisDdf` object, nearly all of the attributes have not been populated.

```{r hdfs_ddf_update, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
# update irisDdf attributes
irisDdf <- updateAttributes(irisDdf)
```

### D&R Example

Let's see how the code looks for the D&R example on the HDFS data:

```{r hdfs_byspecies, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
# divide HDFS data by species
bySpecies <- divide(irisDdf,
  by = "Species",
  output = hdfsConn("/tmp/bySpecies", autoYes=TRUE),
  update = TRUE)
```

As with the local disk data, we specify an HDFS output connection, indicating to store the results of the division to `"/tmp/bySpecies"` on HDFS.  As with local disk data, this object and all meta data persists on disk.

If we were to leave our R session and want to reinstate our `bySpecies` object in a new session:

```{r remove_hdfs_byspecies, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
# reinitialize "bySpecies" by connecting to its path on HDFS
bySpecies <- ddf(hdfsConn("/tmp/bySpecies"))
```

The code for the recombination remains exactly the same:

```{r hdfs_recombine, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
# transform bySpecies to a data frame of lm coefficients
bySpeciesLm <- addTransform(bySpecies, function(x) {
  coefs <- coef(lm(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length, data = x))
  data.frame(slope = coefs[2], intercept = coefs[1])
})
# compute lm coefficients for each division and rbind them
recombine(bySpeciesLm, combRbind)
```

### Interacting with HDFS ddo/ddf objects

All interactions with HDFS ddo/ddf objects are still the same as those we have seen so far.

```{r hdfs_access, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
bySpecies[[1]]
bySpecies[["Species=setosa"]]
```

However, there are a few caveats about extractors for these objects.  If you specify a numeric index, `i`, the extractor method returns the key-value pair for the `i`th key, as available from `getKeys()`.  Thus, if you don't have your object keys read in, you can't access data in this way.  Another important thing to keep in mind is that retrieving data by key for data on HDFS requires that the data is in a Hadoop *mapfile*.

### Hadoop mapfiles

Random access by key for datadr data objects stored on Hadoop requires that they are stored in a valid mapfile.  By default, the result of any `r rdl("divide()")` operation returns a mapfile.  The user need not worry about the details of this -- if operations that require the data to be a valid mapfile are not given a mapfile, they will complain and tell you to convert your data to a mapfile.

For example, recall from our original data object, `irisDdf`, that the connection stated that the file type was a *sequence* file.  Let's try to retrieve the subset with key `"key1"`:

```{r hdfs iriskv_mapfile, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
irisDdf[["key1"]]
```

We have been told to call `r rdl("makeExtractable()")` on this data to make subsets extractable by key.

```{r hdfs_makeExtractable, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
# make data into a mapfile
irisDdf <- makeExtractable(irisDdf)
```

Note that this requires a complete read and write of your data.  You should only worry about doing this if you absolutely need random access by key.  The only major requirement for this outside of your own purposes is for use in Trelliscope.

Let's try to get that subset by key again:

```{r hdfs iriskv_mapfile2, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
irisDdf[["key1"]]
```

### MapReduce Example

Here we again find the top 5 `iris` records according to sepal width.

```{r hdfs_top5, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
# map returns top 5 rows according to sepal width
top5map <- expression({
  counter("map", "mapTasks", 1)
  v <- do.call(rbind, map.values)
  collect("top5", v[order(v$Sepal.Width, decreasing=TRUE)[1:5],])
})

# reduce collects map results and then iteratively rbinds them and returns top 5
top5reduce <- expression(
  pre = {
    top5 <- NULL
  }, reduce = {
    top5 <- rbind(top5, do.call(rbind, reduce.values))
    top5 <- top5[order(top5$Sepal.Width, decreasing=TRUE)[1:5],]
  }, post = {
    collect(reduce.key, top5)
  }
)

# execute the job
top5 <- mrExec(bySpecies, map = top5map, reduce = top5reduce)
# get the result
top5[[1]]
```

### `control` options

For fine control over different parameters of a RHIPE / Hadoop job (and there are many parameters), we use the `control` argument to any of the datadr functions providing MapReduce functionality (`r rdl("divide()")`, `r rdl("mrExec()")`, etc.).

We can set RHIPE control parameters with the function `r rdl("rhipeControl()")`, which creates a named list of parameters and their values.  If a parameter isn't explicitly specified, its default is used.  The parameters available are:

- `mapred`
- `setup`
- `combiner`
- `cleanup`
- `orderby`
- `shared`
- `jarfiles`
- `zips`
- `jobname`

See the documentation for the RHIPE function `rhwatch` for details about these:

```r
?rhwatch
```

The first three parameters in the list are the most important and often-used, particularly `mapred`, which is a list specifying specific Hadoop parameters such as `mapred.reduce.tasks` which can help tune a job.

Defaults for these can be seen by calling `r rdl("rhipeControl()")` with no arguments.:

```{r rhipe_default_control, eval=FALSE}
rhipeControl()
```

## Conversion

In many cases, it is useful to be able to convert from one key-value backend to another.  For example, we might have some smaller data out on HDFS that we would like to move to local disk.  Or we might have in-memory data that is looking too large and we want to take advantage of parallel processing so we want to push it to local disk or HDFS.

We can convert data from one backend to another using the `r rdl("convert()")` method.  The general syntax is `convert(from, to)` where `from` is a ddo/ddf, and `to` is a "kvConnection" object.  When `to=NULL`, we are converting to in-memory.

```{r conversion, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
# initialize irisDdf HDFS ddf object
irisDdf <- ddo(hdfsConn("/tmp/irisKV"))
# convert from HDFS to in-memory ddf
irisDdfMem <- convert(from = irisDdf)
# convert from HDFS to local disk ddf
irisDdfDisk <- convert(from = irisDdf,
  to = localDiskConn(file.path(tempdir(), "irisKVdisk"), autoYes=TRUE))
```

All possible conversions (disk -> HDFS, disk -> memory, HDFS -> disk, HDFS -> memory, memory -> disk, memory -> HDFS) have `r rdl("convert()")` methods implemented.

## Reading in Data

One of the most difficult parts of analyzing very large data sets is getting the original data into a format suitable for analysis.  This package provides some convenience functions for reading data in from text files, either collections of very large text files on a local file system that are to be read in sequentially, or collections of very large text files on HDFS.

### Reading in local text files

Delimited text files can be read in using the `r rdl("drRead.table()")` family of functions.  This function reads blocks of lines of text files, converts them to a data frame, and stores the result as a value in a key-value pair.  For more difficult, less-structured text inputs, it is possible to write custom MapReduce jobs to read in the data.

As an example, suppose the iris data was given to us as a csv file:

```{r csv}
# create a csv file to treat as text input
csvFile <- file.path(tempdir(), "iris.csv")
write.csv(iris, file = csvFile, row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
# see what the file looks like
system(paste("head", csvFile))
```

We want to get this into a format suitable for analysis in R.

```{r readtext, message=FALSE}
# connection for where to store output
irisConn <- localDiskConn(file.path(tempdir(), "iris"), autoYes = TRUE)
# read in iris data
irisData <- drRead.csv(csvFile, rowsPerBlock = 20, output = irisConn)
# look at resulting object
irisData
# look at a subset
irisData[[1]]
```

We can pass a vector of file paths, and can tweak the subset size with the `rowsPerBlock` argument.

The same can be done with data on HDFS.  In that case, the input is an HDFS connection with `type="text"` instead of a path.
